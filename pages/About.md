I am Edward Feng, a passionate and curious second-year computer scientist at University of Toronto. I enjoy building projects and learning about new technology and future trends. I have a strong interest in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data, and what each field can bring to the society and make this world a better place.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, programming, and learning about others' life experience.

I am currently looking for a summer internship in a reputable place where I can utilize my skills and build my experience.
