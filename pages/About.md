I am Edward Feng, a passionate and curious second-year computer scientist at University of Toronto. I enjoy building projects and learning about new technology and future trends. I am currently looking for a summer internship in a reputable place where I can utilize my skills and build my experience. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports.
