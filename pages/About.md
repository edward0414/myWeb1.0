I am Edward Feng, a passionate and curious second-year computer scientist at the University of Toronto. I enjoy building projects and learning about new technology and future trends. I have a strong interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data. My goal is to use my skills I learn from each field to create software that can benefit the world.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, programming, and exploring the nature.

I am currently looking for a summer internship in a reputable place where I can utilize my skills and build my experience.
